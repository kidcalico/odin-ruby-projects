# The Odin Project - Ruby: Tic Tac Toe

This is a basic tic tac toe game, to be run in the terminal. The game
requires two human players, as it does not yet incorporate a computer
player.

This project was completed for the Ruby Course in [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com).

This project held a lot of firsts for me:
- Using Object Oriented Programming
- Implementing a multi-file structure (using Ruby, at least)
- Linting and Formatting using RuboCop
- Using a Gemfile to manage Gems

I realize that there are probably better ways this project could be
organized and look forward to coming back and doing some refactoring
once I've gotten further into The Odin Project and have gained some
more programming wisdom. For now I am happy to be utilizing all of this
newfound knowledge.
