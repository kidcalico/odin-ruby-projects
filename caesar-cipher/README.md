# The Odin Project: Caesar Cipher

Create a Ruby method which accepts a string and an integer, and which 
uses the integer as a shift key to encode the string, ignoring all non
alphabet characters.

I implemented the map enumerable, along with conditional statements and
ord and chr methods. In order to allow the use of any integer, I used
a modulus operator.
