# The Odin Project: Hangman

Another fun challenge. This was my first time utilizing serialization, in this case 
for the purpose of saving the progress in one's Hangman game. Each time the game is 
started, the word list is randomized, then the player has to go through and guess 
each word. This was a challenging project, though not quite as difficult as the 
Mastermind computer codebreaker.

In the future I wouldn't mind adding a scoring methodology to this game. Easy to do
but for now I am going full steam ahead into more of the Odin Project. That's all for
now.
