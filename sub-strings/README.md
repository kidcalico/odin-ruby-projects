# The Odin Project: Sub Strings

The goal of this project was to write a method which takes a string and
an 'dictionary' array of single word strings as arguments. The method 
creates a hash which keeps a tally of how many times each word in the
'dictionary' appears in the string argument. This includes substrings,
and ignores case so "I" appears in "I am fine" twice.

This project was good practice using nested enumerables, which were a
little tricky at first.
